# Changelog

## 0.2.1

- Lines with several variants to the same destination (a way via a village, a short run) are told apart by the relation's name instead of showing the same button twice.

## 0.2.0

- Menu: stops near you, lines and directions, route card (length, ride time, stops, how often it runs), start from this stop or from
  the first one, departure time with the game clock set to it, opposite direction, results with grade and your best.
- HUD app `EarthBusHud`: destination blind, next stop with delay and distance, line diagram, passengers on board, score.
- Generated timetable (city, regional, night; rush hours; weekends) and a passenger flow that follows the time of day.
- Bus stations (`amenity=bus_station`) take their numbered platforms under the station's name.
- The data comes through the Earth Bus Routes data service (`Robitnik/earth-bus-routes-data`): the game's sandbox cannot reach the internet.
